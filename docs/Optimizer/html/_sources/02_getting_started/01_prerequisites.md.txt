# Installation prerequisites

Optimizer relies on Python 3.x. Before installing Optimizer, we recommend you first install the Anaconda package manager. See [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows) for Windows and [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos) for macOS / Linux installations (Python 3.x version).


## Python virtual environments

Before installing requirements, use `conda` to create a new virtual environment for your project.

### Using `conda`

If you haven't used it before, see the `conda` getting started guide [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda) for instructions on how to create a new environment. Otherwise, just activate your environment as usual.

#### Installing requirements

Anaconda will come with the Pip package manager, which can be used to install the Optimizer requirements:

```
pip install -r optimizer/requirements.txt
```
